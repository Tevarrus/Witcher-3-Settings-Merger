# Witcher-3-Settings-Merger
Automates merging all your mods' various input and user settings fragments into the main input.settings, user.settings, and dx12user.settings files. Auto-detects game directories, finds scattered mod settings files, integrates while avoiding duplication or false positives. Supports Vortex/symlinks but should work across platforms.
